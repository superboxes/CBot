# CBot
This is a super simple bot coded with c++ using the super fast library of dpp

Here's a simple tutorial on how to compile & run this bot.

1. Download d++ (https://dpp.dev/md_docpages_01_installing.html), I use arch linux so I just did "yay -S dpp".
2. Literally code it up.
3. Compile it with "g++ mybot.cpp -o mybot -ldpp" (REPLACE mybot.cpp with your bot's source code).
4. Run the executable, I use arch so i do "./mybot".
